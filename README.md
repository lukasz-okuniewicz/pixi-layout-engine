# Layout Controller

A flexible layout utility for arranging display objects (e.g., PIXI.js components) inside a container.
It provides multiple layout strategies such as horizontal, vertical, circle, grid, and various creative and data-driven patterns.

## üéÆ Demo
Try it out here: [pixi-layout-engine Live Editor](https://lukasz-okuniewicz.github.io/pixi-layout-engine-ui/)

---

## üì¶ Installation

```js
npm i pixi-layout-engine
```

```js
import { applyLayout, layoutEnum } from "pixi-layout-engine";
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

```js
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import { applyLayout, layoutEnum } from "pixi-layout-engine";

// 1. Create a PIXI.Container
const container = new PIXI.Container();

// 2. Create your display objects (sprites, graphics, etc.)
const sprite1 = new PIXI.Sprite(PIXI.Texture.WHITE);
const sprite2 = new PIXI.Sprite(PIXI.Texture.WHITE);
const sprite3 = new PIXI.Sprite(PIXI.Texture.WHITE);

// 3. Add the objects as children of the container
container.addChild(sprite1, sprite2, sprite3);

// 4. Apply a layout directly to the container
applyLayout(container, {
  layoutName: layoutEnum.CIRCLE,
  radius: 150,
  rotateToCenter: true,
});
```

## üì± Responsive Layouts

You can easily define different layout options for `portrait` and `landscape` orientations. The engine will automatically merge the correct configuration for you.

This is handled by three new properties in the options object:

-   `orientation` (`"portrait"` | `"landscape"`) ‚Äì The current device orientation. This tells the layout engine which set of overrides to apply.
-   `portrait` (object) ‚Äì An object containing any layout options that should **override** the base settings when `orientation` is `"portrait"`.
-   `landscape` (object) ‚Äì An object containing any layout options that should **override** the base settings when `orientation` is `"landscape"`.

### Responsive Usage Example

```js
import { applyLayout, layoutEnum } from "pixi-layout-engine";

// 1. Define a single layout object with responsive overrides
const responsiveGridLayout = {
  // Base options shared by both orientations
  layoutName: layoutEnum.SQUARE,
  spacing: 15,

  // Options for portrait mode
  portrait: {
    columns: 4,
    flowDirection: "default",
  },

  // Options for landscape mode
  landscape: {
    columns: 8,
    flowDirection: "snake",
  },
};

// 2. In your application logic, detect the current orientation
function updateLayout() {
  const isPortrait = window.innerHeight > window.innerWidth;
  const currentOrientation = isPortrait ? 'portrait' : 'landscape';

  // 3. Apply the layout, passing the current orientation
  applyLayout(container, {
    ...responsiveGridLayout,
    orientation: currentOrientation,
  });
}

// Call it on load and on resize
window.addEventListener('resize', updateLayout);
updateLayout(); // Initial call
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

Each layout accepts different options for customization:

### Component-Specific Properties
Some layouts respond to properties set on the individual `LayoutComponent` objects themselves.
- `value` (number) ‚Äì Used by all **Data-Driven Layouts** (like `BUBBLE`, `TREEMAP`) and by the `SQUARE` grid's `value-weighted-*` flow directions to determine size or sort order.
- `group` (string) ‚Äì For the `SQUARE` grid's `clustered-fill` flow, specifies which visual group an item belongs to.
- `colSpan` (number) ‚Äì For the `SQUARE` grid (in `useGridSpanning` mode), specifies how many columns an item should occupy.
- `rowSpan` (number) ‚Äì For the `SQUARE` grid (in `useGridSpanning` mode), specifies how many rows an item should occupy.
- `zoneName` (string) ‚Äì For the `PAYOUT_ZONES` layout, specifies which named zone an item belongs to.
The CIRCLE_PACK layout relies on the value property, just like the other data-driven layouts. While value is already mentioned in the Data-Driven Layouts section, it's good practice to ensure it's clearly associated. Your current documentation for this is already sufficient as it covers all data-driven layouts.

### General Options
These options are used by many different layouts.
- `spacing` (number) ‚Äì Gap between components (default: `0`).

  - `flowDirection` (string) ‚Äì Determines the visual pattern used to fill the grid. This is the most powerful option, accepting dozens of values, including:

### External Parsers
Some layouts require external libraries to function. You must provide them in the options.
- **Path Layout**: Requires a path parser compatible with svg-path-properties.
- **Voronoi Layout**: Requires a Voronoi/Delaunay utility compatible with d3-delaunay.

---

## üìê Return Value

The internal layout functions return a Bounds object describing the bounding box of the positioned components:

```js
{
  minX: number,
  minY: number,
  maxX: number,
  maxY: number
}
```
The main `applyLayout` function uses this to calculate the total width (maxX - minX) and height (maxY - minY) and **automatically centers the layout** by adjusting the container's position.

---

## üìù Example

```js
// Square grid with spacing and snake flow
applyLayout(container, {
  layoutName: layoutEnum.SQUARE,
  columns: 4,
  spacing: 20,
  flowDirection: "snake",
  lastRowAlign: "center",
});
```

```js
// Path layout using an external parser
import { Properties } from 'svg-path-properties';

applyLayout(container, {
  layoutName: layoutEnum.PATH,
  path: 'M 0 0 C 50 150, 150 -50, 200 100',
  pathParser: Properties, // Pass the class constructor
  rotateToPath: true,
});
```

```js
// A Circle Packing layout
// Ensure each component has a `value` property, e.g., sprite1.value = 50;
applyLayout(container, {
  layoutName: layoutEnum.CIRCLE_PACK,
  boundsRadius: 300,
  padding: 5
});
```

```js
// A Card Hand layout for a game UI
applyLayout(container, {
  layoutName: layoutEnum.CARD_HAND,
  arcRadius: 400,
  arcAngle: 35
});
```

```js
// Creating a messy discard pile for a card game
applyLayout(container, {
  layoutName: layoutEnum.STACK,
  offsetX: 0.5,
  offsetY: 0.5,
  offsetRotation: 0.2 // A very slight rotation per card
});
```

```js
// A layout for a betting table with chips in different zones
const bettingZones = [
  { name: 'pass_line', bounds: { x: 0, y: 100, width: 400, height: 50 } },
  { name: 'big_6', bounds: { x: 420, y: 0, width: 80, height: 80 } }
];

// Assign zoneName to each chip component
chip1.zoneName = 'pass_line';
chip2.zoneName = 'big_6';
chip3.zoneName = 'pass_line';

// Make sure chip1, chip2, and chip3 have been added to the container.
// e.g., container.addChild(chip1, chip2, chip3);

applyLayout(container, {
  layoutName: layoutEnum.PAYOUT_ZONES,
  zones: bettingZones,
  zoneLayout: layoutEnum.BUBBLE // Arrange chips in each zone like a pile
});
```

---

## üîî Notes
- If the `layoutName` option is omitted, the system defaults to `layoutEnum.SQUARE`.
- If an unknown `layoutName` is provided, the system defaults to a horizontal `LINE` layout.
- The container's position is automatically managed to center the layout. To place the centered layout on your screen, simply add the container's final position to your desired screen coordinates (e.g., container.x += screen.width / 2).
